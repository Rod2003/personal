### Feedback for site

- Overall structure needs simplification
  - Help command shows too many options at once - overwhelming
  - Commands lack context for non-technical users
  - Need hover descriptions for each command
- Technical/non-technical mode toggle
  - Advanced mode: full command line interface for developers
  - Simple mode: accessible for recruiters, VPs, senior staff
  - Shows understanding of UX and audience needs
- Visual elements causing confusion
  - Artistic design elements don’t signify anything meaningful
  - Not symmetrical, especially problematic on mobile
  - Prefer text-only to the right instead
- Resume command removal
  - Currently shows old, publicly available resume
  - Should be removed entirely
- Unnecessary commands to eliminate
  1. Banner - redundant with existing header
  2. CD - meaningless to non-technical users
  3. Google - just redirects to search engine
  4. Exit - serves no real purpose
  5. Time tracking - shows website visit duration, adds no value
